# Semantic Search Web API

This is a simple dockerized Web API originally created as a semantic search service to use on android devices for my **Natural language processing** projects.

The current API is built with the help of the [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework

although I'm slowly but steadily working on a Rust version using the [Rocket framework](https://rocket.rs/) as an excuse to learn Rust.

The model used for the API is adapted from the library [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers), which offers a wide variety of options for very performant sentence embeddings models, which is in turn based on the popular [transformers](https://huggingface.co/) library by Huggingface
